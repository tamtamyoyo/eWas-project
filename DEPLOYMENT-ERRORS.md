# eWas.com Deployment Errors and Solutions

## Current Deployment Issues

Based on the Railway deployment logs, the following issues are preventing successful deployment:

### 1. Missing Critical Environment Variables

**Error:** Supabase client not initialized. Missing SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

**Solution:** Configure the following critical environment variables in Railway:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`

### 2. Database Connection Issue

**Error:** `Failed to initialize subscription plans: TypeError: db.select is not a function`

**Solutions:**
- Ensure your `DATABASE_URL` is correct and points to a valid PostgreSQL database
- Check database schema is properly set up
- Make sure the database user has proper permissions

### 3. Missing OpenAI API Key

**Error:** `OpenAIError: The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty`

**Solution:** 
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to a valid key, or
- Modify the code to make the OpenAI feature optional

### 4. Missing Social Media API Credentials

**Errors:** Multiple warnings about missing social media credentials:
- Twitter API keys are missing
- Facebook API credentials are missing
- Instagram API credentials are missing
- Snapchat API credentials are missing
- TikTok API credentials are missing
- YouTube API credentials are missing

**Solution:**
The application has been updated to make these integrations optional, so the app will run without them, but those features will be disabled.

## Quick Fix Instructions

1. Use the included `setup-railway-env.js` script to generate a proper `.env.railway` file:
   ```
   node setup-railway-env.js
   ```

2. Upload the generated `.env.railway` file to Railway:
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Click on the "Variables" tab
   - Click "New Variable"
   - Select "Import from .env"
   - Upload the `.env.railway` file

3. At minimum, you must configure these variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - `SESSION_SECRET`

4. Redeploy your application after setting the variables.

## Using the Application with Limited Features

If you don't want to configure all the social media integrations immediately, the application will run with limited functionality. The following features will be disabled:

- OpenAI AI Assistant (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Twitter integration (requires `TWITTER_API_KEY` and `TWITTER_API_SECRET`)
- Facebook integration (requires `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`)
- LinkedIn integration (requires `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID` and `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- And other social media platforms

You can add these later as needed without having to restart the deployment process.

# Authentication Flow Analysis and Fixes

## Problem Description
The authentication system is experiencing redirect issues:
1. After successful login, users are redirected back to login page instead of dashboard
2. Sometimes redirects to forgot password page
3. Google authentication has similar redirect issues

## Code Analysis

### Authentication Flow Components
1. Client-side auth handling in:
   - `client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
   - `client/src/components/auth/AuthForm.tsx`
   - `client/src/pages/Login.tsx`
   - `client/src/pages/GoogleCallback.tsx`

2. Server-side auth handling in:
   - `server/routes.ts` (auth endpoints)
   - `server/services/google.ts` (Google OAuth)

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Session Management Issues**
- Session configuration in server/routes.ts may not be persisting properly
- Client-side auth state not being synchronized with server state

2. **Redirect Logic Problems**
- Multiple competing redirect methods being used (setLocation vs window.location)
- Race conditions between auth state updates and redirects

3. **Google Auth Flow Issues**
- Incomplete state management after Google auth completion
- Redirect URLs not properly configured

## Required Fixes

### 1. Session Configuration Fix
The session configuration needs proper secure settings and domain configuration.

### 2. Auth State Management Fix
Need to implement proper auth state persistence and synchronization.

### 3. Redirect Logic Fix
Standardize redirect approach and ensure proper auth state check before redirects.

### 4. Google Auth Flow Fix
Improve Google auth callback handling and redirect logic.

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix session configuration
2. Update auth state management
3. Standardize redirect logic
4. Improve Google auth flow

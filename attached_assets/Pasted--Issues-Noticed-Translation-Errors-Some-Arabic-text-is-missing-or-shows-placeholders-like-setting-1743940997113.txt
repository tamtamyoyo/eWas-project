 Issues Noticed:
Translation Errors:

Some Arabic text is missing or shows placeholders like settings.profileInformation or settings.saveChanges.

Many labels and buttons appear as keys rather than translated text (e.g., connect.autoPublishDesc, connect.analyticsDesc).

Incomplete Dark Mode Implementation:

Not all components switch to dark mode properly.

Certain cards and panels remain in light mode even when dark mode is active.

Visual Inconsistencies:

The colorful header mentioned (like ContentStudio) isn't properly implemented yet.

The navigation menu has a plain look; it could be made more visually appealing with icons, better spacing, and some hover animations.

Missing Features or Incomplete Implementations:

Google Sign-In is giving errors; need to ensure the provider is correctly configured and enabled.

Snapchat integration appears inactive or incomplete.

The Analytics page seems limited in data scope and doesn't provide a clear overview or insight into content performance.

Styling Issues:

Buttons and elements look basic; adding shadows, rounded corners, or subtle animations would enhance the user experience.

Text and input fields sometimes lack padding, making them look cramped.

Lack of consistency in the use of fonts and font sizes across the application.

Accessibility Issues:

The app doesn't seem to offer any accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).

Poor color contrast in some parts of the dark mode could be problematic.

ðŸ“Œ Recommendations:
Fix Translation Keys:

Go through your Arabic and English locale files and add the missing keys.

Add smooth animations and transitions to make the app feel more interactive.
